The Placement Cell Management System permits the Student to login/sign-up into the application and view current job
opportunities available. The System would store all the academic as well as personal details of the
students who wish to be placed and the Companies who offer jobs to the students. Students can
apply for the jobs if they are eligible. The admin can manage the database and post upcoming job or
internship opportunity which can be viewed by the students who are eligible for it. Admin can also
view the Statistics of Current Placement Drive.
